# Semaphore Ghost - Potential Use-After-Free Analysis

## Metadata
- **Component:** Semaphore Subsystem  
- **File:** osfmk/kern/sync_sema.c
- **Function:** semaphore_destroy
- **Type:** Potential Use-After-Free (CWE-416)
- **Status:** Investigation Required
- **Discovery Method:** Corgea SAST Analysis + manual audit

## Overview
Static analysis identified a potential Use-After-Free condition in the XNU semaphore destruction mechanism where a semaphore object might be accessed after being freed.

## Technical Analysis

### Issue Description
The vulnerability pattern involves the semaphore_destroy function where semaphore_destroy_internal may free the semaphore object, but semaphore_dereference is still called afterward, potentially accessing freed memory.

### Code Flow Analysis
1. Function receives semaphore object
2. Ownership validation checks performed
3. If owner matches, calls semaphore_destroy_internal
4. Regardless of ownership, calls semaphore_dereference at function end
5. Potential UAF if semaphore was freed in step 3

## Verification Requirements

### Critical Functions for Analysis
- semaphore_destroy_internal - must determine if this frees semaphore
- semaphore_dereference - reference counting implementation  
- semaphore_free - memory deallocation logic
- Reference count management throughout call chain

### Key Questions
- Does semaphore_destroy_internal directly or indirectly free semaphore memory?
- How does semaphore_dereference handle zero reference counts?
- What synchronization exists between destruction and dereference operations?

## Impact Assessment
- **Potential Impact:** Kernel memory corruption
- **Exploitation Complexity:** High
- **Privilege Required:** User-level access  
- **Attack Vector:** Race conditions during semaphore operations
- **System Impact:** Potential kernel panic or instability

## Current Status
- **SAST Detection:** Confirmed by Corgea
- **Manual Verification:** Pending code review
- **Proof-of-Concept:** Not developed
- **Exploitation Feasibility:** Unconfirmed

## Research Notes
- Initial detection via automated static analysis
- Requires manual audit of semaphore lifecycle management
- Complex reference counting may cause false positive
- Similar patterns found in other kernel synchronization primitives
